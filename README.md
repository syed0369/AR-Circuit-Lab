# AR Circuit Lab

AR Circuit Lab is an interactive Augmented Reality application for visualizing and simulating electronic circuits. Built with Unity, it provides an engaging platform for learning and experimenting with circuit components in a 3D environment.

## Features
- Augmented Reality visualization of electronic circuits
- Interactive circuit building and simulation
- Real-time feedback and error checking
- User-friendly UI for component selection and placement
- Support for custom circuit designs
- Educational tutorials and guides

## Project Structure
- **Assets/**: Contains all Unity assets, including scripts, scenes, models, materials, prefabs, UI, and resources.
- **Packages/**: Package dependencies and manifest for Unity.
- **ProjectSettings/**: Unity project settings and configuration files.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity Hub (recommended)
- Unity Editor (2021.3 LTS or later)
- [Optional] Vuforia SDK for AR features

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Unity Hub and add the project folder.
3. Open the project in Unity Editor.
4. Install required packages via Unity Package Manager (see Packages/manifest.json).
